Last Commit #15 - [v0.0.7]
	1. Adjusted piece.availableMoves() to add locations if something is there. 
		Then lets PLACE.capturePiece() & PLACE.isOpponent() figure out if it's possible to move there
	2. Capturing pieces is now possible
	3. Program keeps track of which pieces were captured and each teams total piecePoints
	4. Keeps track of turn order, and only lets current team pieces move
	5. Next Goals:
		a. Visual Rework
