Last Commit #18 - [v0.0.74]
	1. Created "moveCalculator.py"
		a. Piece Moves working as they were previously
			i. 	PIECE.availableMoves() deleted
			ii.	PLACE.findMyNextMoves(location, pieceObject) now handles PIECE.availableMoves()

			i.	Will clean up the .showMyMoves()
			ii.	Will better setup the check/checkmate logic
		b. Visual representation of a king in check/checkmate
