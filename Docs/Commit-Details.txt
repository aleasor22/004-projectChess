Goal of Document: To further elaborate on what each commit is, changes made, project goals/tasks completed.


Current Commit #16 - [v0.0.7]
	1. Adjusted piece.availableMoves() to add locations if something is there. 
		Then lets PLACE.capturePiece() & PLACE.isOpponent() figure out if it's possible to move there
	2. Capturing pieces is now possible
	3. Program keeps track of which pieces were captured and each teams total piecePoints
	4. Keeps track of turn order, and only lets current team pieces move
	5. Next Goals:
		a. Visual Rework
		b. Logic to Win/Lose the game
		c. Menu Bar

Last Commit #15 - [v0.0.67]:
	1. Cleaned up various commented code
	2. Cleaned up PAWN.availableMoves()
	3. capturePiece logic initial stage is completed
		a. Pawns can now capture Pieces
		b. Other piece cannot because self.canMoveHere logic still avoids all active locaitons
	3. Next Goals:
		a. Allow other pieces to move to open & opponent locations
			i. Verify the capturePiece method still works for other pieces
