Current Commit #23 - [v0.0.774]
	1. Created logic to flip the board during setup
	2. Attempt #5 - Check/Checkmate Logic 
		a. More testing resulted in Check logic being inconsistent.
		b. These moves being forced has also become inconsistent
		c. self.__activeLocations is now self._pieces
		d. Created checkLogic.py - cleaned up moveCalculator.py but didn't solve previous issues.
	3. Goals:

Last Commit #22 - [v0.0.772]
	1. Attempt #4 - Check/Checkmate logic (FAIL)
		a. Successfully used the KING.dangerZone/.threats/.inCheck for check logic
		b. Successfully got pieces to force moves that protect the king.
		c. Then changed self.__activeLocations key to use PIECE.myID instead of .locationID
			i.	 This broke everything
			ii.	 The king will toggle .inCheck rather than stay as True or False
			iii. Official end of Attempt #4 for Check/Checkmate logic
	2. Next Plan of action:
		a. Make a new class LOGIC - "checkLogic.py" to calculate  and monitor information relating to a king being in check
			i.	 It  will be a parent  to moveCalculator.py
			ii.	 Will clean up moveCalulator.
			iii. Goal of fixing issue with current .inCheck boolean logic
			iv.	 Marks the start of Attempt #5
