Current Commit (#9 [v0.0.564]):
	1. Bishop and Queen move detection logic now account for active/inactive squares.
		a. Still doesn't know what/who is in an active square.
	2. Created this document to summarize changes between commits
	3. Pieces to change move detection based on active pieces
		a. [Knight, King, Pawn]
	4. After the remaining pieces have move logic adjusted. The goal to add piece capturing. This will be done by determining who is in a square, which team they're on, add the square to movement options if the piece's on another team


Last Commit (#8 [v0.0.563]):
	1. A basic form of piece tracking was created using "__myPieceMatrix"
		a. A double matrix that shows "**" for empty locations and the location title for filled/active spots (EX. "a1" or "c7")
		b. Used to tell if another piece is there, however doesn't know which piece is actually there
	2. Adjusted the Rook's move detection logic to account for active/inactive pieces
	3. Made ".avalableMoves()" get called every time a piece is selected.
