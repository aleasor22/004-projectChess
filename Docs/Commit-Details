	2. Created this document to summarize changes between commits
	3. Pieces to change move detection based on active pieces
		a. [Knight, King, Pawn]
	4. After the remaining pieces have move logic adjusted. The goal to add piece capturing. This will be done by determining who is in a square, which team they're on, add the square to movement options if the piece's on another team
